# Challenge-Collecting-Data

## Description
This project aims to collect real estate data from various sources in Belgium to build a comprehensive dataset for predicting property prices. The collected dataset will contain detailed information about at least 10,000 properties and will be used for training a machine learning model to predict real estate prices.

The dataset includes information such as locality, property type, price, number of rooms, surface areas, features (like garden, swimming pool), and much more. This data will help in creating a robust and accurate model for real estate price predictions.
